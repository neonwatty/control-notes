## Installation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

To successfully run the Jupyter notebooks contained in this repo we highly recommend downloading the [Anaconda Python 3 distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos). Many of these notebooks also employ the Automatic Differentiator [autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd) which can be installed by typing the following command at your terminal
      
      pip install autograd
      
With minor adjustment users can also run these notebooks using the GPU/TPU extended version of autograd [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).<br><br><br>
