In the present case the consequence of such systems being limited by their order is perhaps most clearly seen by a simple example of a Markov chain model of text.  For example, suppose we have constructed a word-based Markov model of order $D = 1$, whose transition probabilities have been determined using a large text corpus.

    "In discussing Markov chains its pretty commonplace to represent each fundamental unit (that is each word or character) by a numerical value.  For example if we were working on the character level we could represent each character by a unique integer - this is often called \"token-izing\" the characters of a text (we did this in our implementation above).  Another common numerical translation is the \"one-hot encoding\" scheme where we translated each character into a unique standard basis vector, as shown for a few characters in the Figure 1 below."
